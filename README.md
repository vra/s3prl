## Update in this fork
This fork add the onnx and [MNN](https://github.com/alibaba/MNN) version of wavlm_large model for audio embedding extraction. With onnx or mnn model, you will not need to run any model definition and no more torch.hub.load issue. All you need is a `.onnx` or `.mnn` file and less than 60 lines of code.

### Changes:
+ Update some code in `s3prl/upstream/wavlm/expert.py` to support onnx exporting, see [this commit](https://github.com/vra/s3prl/commit/bb2e635c434bbf8c5a385b990e2ab6b636134d5f).
+ Add infer code of pytorch model for wavlm large to demostrate the embedding extract pipeline
+ Add infer code of onnx model
+ Add infer code of mnn model

### Model Download
- onnx: <https://huggingface.co/yunfengwang/wavlm-large-onnx>
- mnn: <https://huggingface.co/yunfengwang/wavlm-large-mnn>

### Export Pytorch model to onnx
```bash
python demo.py -t export -m /path/to/wavlm_large_finetune.pth -o wavlm_large.onnx
```

## Convert onnx to mnn
You need to install MNN First:
```bash
pip install MNN
```
then run commands:
```bash
# convert using fp16 
mnnconvert -f ONNX --modelFile wavlm_large.onnx --MNNModel wavlm_large_fp16.mnn --fp16

# convert using quant_bit 8
mnnconvert -f ONNX --modelFile wavlm_large.onnx --MNNModel wavlm_large_int8.mnn.mnn --weightQuantBits 8 --weightQuantAsymmetric
```

### Pytorch inference
You need to download wavlm_large_finetune.pth from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-aE1NfzpRCLxA4GUxX9ITI3F9LlbtEGP/view?usp=sharing)
```bash
python demo.py -t infer -m /path/to/wavlm_large_finetune.pth -i /path/to/audio
```

### ONNX model inferce
```bash
python infer_onnx.py -m wavlm_large.onnx -i /path/to/audio
```

### MNN model inferce
```bash
python infer_mnn.py -m wavlm_large_fp16.mnn -i /path/to/audio
```

### Verification use case
You can use pytorch/onnx/mnn model to do speaker verification task.

use Pytorch:
```bash
python verification.py -m /path/to/wavlm_large_finetune.pth -t pytorch --input_audio_path1 /path/to/audio1 --input_audio_path2 /path/to/audio2
```
use ONNX:
```bash
python verification.py -m /path/to/wavlm_large.onnx -t onnx --input_audio_path1 /path/to/audio1 --input_audio_path2 /path/to/audio2
```
use MNN:

We encourage to cite the individual papers most related to the function you are using to give fair credit to the developer of the function. You can find the names in the [Change Log](#change-log). Finally, we would like to thank our advisor, [Prof. Hung-yi Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php), for his advice. The project would be impossible without his support.

If you have any question (e.g., about who came up with / developed which ideas / functions or how the project started), feel free to engage in an open and responsible conversation on the GitHub issue page, and we'll be happy to help!

## Contribution (pull request)

**Guideline**

- Starting in 2024, we will only accept new contributions in the form of new upstream models, so we can save bandwidth for developing new techniques (which will not be in S3PRL.)
- S3PRL has transitioned into pure maintenance mode, ensuring the long-term maintenance of all existing functions.
- Reporting bugs or the PR fixing the bugs is always welcome! Thanks!

**Tutorials**

- [General tutorial](https://s3prl.github.io/s3prl/contribute/general.html)
- [Tutorial for adding new upstream models](https://s3prl.github.io/s3prl/contribute/upstream.html)

## Introduction and Usages

This is an open source toolkit called **s3prl**, which stands for **S**elf-**S**upervised **S**peech **P**re-training and **R**epresentation **L**earning.
Self-supervised speech pre-trained models are called **upstream** in this toolkit, and are utilized in various **downstream** tasks.

The toolkit has **three major usages**:

### Pretrain

- Pretrain upstream models, including Mockingjay, Audio ALBERT and TERA.
- Document: [**pretrain/README.md**](./s3prl/pretrain/README.md)

### Upstream

- Easily load most of the existing upstream models with pretrained weights in a unified I/O interface.
- Pretrained models are registered through **torch.hub**, which means you can use these models in your own project by one-line plug-and-play without depending on this toolkit's coding style.
- Document: [**upstream/README.md**](./s3prl/upstream/README.md)

### Downstream

- Utilize upstream models in lots of downstream tasks
- Benchmark upstream models with [**SUPERB Benchmark**](./s3prl/downstream/docs/superb.md)
- Document: [**downstream/README.md**](./s3prl/downstream/README.md)

---

Here is a high-level illustration of how S3PRL might help you. We support to leverage numerous SSL representations on numerous speech processing tasks in our [GitHub codebase](https://github.com/s3prl/s3prl):

![interface](file/S3PRL-interface.png)

---

We also modularize all the SSL models into a standalone [PyPi package](https://pypi.org/project/s3prl/) so that you can easily install it and use it without depending on our entire codebase. The following shows a simple example and you can find more details in our [documentation](https://s3prl.github.io/s3prl/).

1. Install the S3PRL package:

```sh
pip install s3prl
```

2. Use it to extract representations for your own audio:

```python
import torch
from s3prl.nn import S3PRLUpstream

model = S3PRLUpstream("hubert")
model.eval()

with torch.no_grad():
    wavs = torch.randn(2, 16000 * 2)
    wavs_len = torch.LongTensor([16000 * 1, 16000 * 2])
    all_hs, all_hs_len = model(wavs, wavs_len)

for hs, hs_len in zip(all_hs, all_hs_len):
    assert isinstance(hs, torch.FloatTensor)
    assert isinstance(hs_len, torch.LongTensor)

    batch_size, max_seq_len, hidden_size = hs.shape
    assert hs_len.dim() == 1
```

---

With this modularization, we have achieved close integration with the general speech processing toolkit [ESPNet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet), enabling the use of SSL models for a broader range of speech processing tasks and corpora to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results (kudos to the [ESPNet Team](https://www.wavlab.org/open_source)):

![integration](file/S3PRL-integration.png)

You can start the journey of SSL with the following entry points:

- S3PRL: [A simple SUPERB downstream task](https://github.com/s3prl/s3prl/blob/main/s3prl/downstream/docs/superb.md#pr-phoneme-recognition)
- ESPNet: [Levearging S3PRL for ASR](https://github.com/espnet/espnet/tree/master/egs2/librispeech/asr1#self-supervised-learning-features-hubert_large_ll60k-conformer-utt_mvn-with-transformer-lm)

## Installation

1. **Python** >= 3.6
2. Install **sox** on your OS
3. Install s3prl: [Read doc](https://s3prl.github.io/s3prl/tutorial/installation.html#) or `pip install -e ".[all]"`
